## Basics of quantum information
This is the first unit of the Understanding Quantum Information and Computation series, which explains quantum information and computation at a detailed mathematical level.

The first unit, Basics of Quantum Information, begins with a mathematical description of quantum information for both single and multiple systems, then moves on to quantum circuits, and finally covers three fundamentally important examples — quantum teleportation, superdense coding, and the CHSH game — all of which are connected to the phenomenon of entanglement.
